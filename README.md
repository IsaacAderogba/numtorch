# NumTorch, a deep learning framework for crafting neural networks

[NumTorch](https://github.com/IsaacAderogba/numtorch) is a Python library that offers tensor computation through the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library and an automatic differentiation system for building dynamic computation graphs.

Created as a learning project from Trask, in Grokking Deep Learning (2019), its API is similar to that of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). At a granular level, the NumTorch libary consists of the following components

| Component  | Description                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Layers     | Higher level API for composing neural network layers.                    |
| Optimizers | Loss functions for optimizing the weights of a neural network.           |
| Operations | Lower level functions that make up the automatic differentiation system. |
